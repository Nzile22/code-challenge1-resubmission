.......speed Dector....
This Node.js script that will use the readline module to prompt the user for a car's speed. Then proceed to calculate and display the number of demerit points based on the speed limit and a given rate of points per kilometer over the limit.

The functionality of this is that the script prompts the user to enter the car's speed. Then proceed to check if the input is a valid number and if it's positive.
If the speed exceeds the speed limit, then then the script calculates the number of demerit points based on the excess speed and the rate of points per kilometer.
what is displayed is  either "Ok" if the speed is within the limit, the number of demerit points, or "License suspended" if the points exceed a certain threshold.

......Salary calculator......
It is a script that calculates net salary by taking basic salary, benefits, and tax brackets into account. It also deducts NHIF and NSSF contributions.
The script prompts the  basic salary and benefits and  checks if the entered values are valid numbers and positive then proceeds to add the basic salary and benefits to get the gross salary.
The next step is to apply  different tax rates based on the gross salary range and calculate NHIF Deductions which determines the NHIF contribution based on predefined salary ranges followed by the ones which NSSF deduction is a fixed 6% of the gross salary.
Finally, it subtracts payee, NHIF, and NSSF from the gross salary to get your net salary then it  displays the breakdown of gross salary, payee, NHIF and NSSF deductions, and your final net salary.
